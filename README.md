We've created a storytelling application that creates and authenticates user accounts, allows verified users to create storylines, add pictures, explore genres and like/dislike current storylines.

Technologies utilized during this project include: 
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
* [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/)
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/index.html) & [Various NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Future Updates we would like to implement include:
* Perfecting our chat feature
* More functionality with storylines (i.e. edit, delete, etc)
* More user account functions
* Ability to view stories by topic or genre
